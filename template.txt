My name is [PERSON-NAME] and I am from [RESIDENCY]. I am contacting you about the city's budget. As a member of this community, I will not stand for the lack of funding for community resources. Funding for these invaluable resources is crucial. The lack thereof directly hurts populations that need more support and will detrimentally impact the greater community of [CITY-NAME]. You are choosing to allocate little funding for community-oriented programs, while the [CITY-NAME] police department is allocated $[POLICE-BUDGET] (in the 2020-2021 budget), which is about [PERCENT]% of the total budget ($[TOTAL-BUDGET]), at a time when police brutality is hurting our communities. This should be unacceptable to you as elected officials expected to act in our best interests. I urge you to make amends to this city budget as it is currently allocated, and to defund the [CITY-NAME] police department in favor of increasing funding for community-led programs that provide access and public resources for those who need it most.
